This section is here to comply with the addon publishing requirements. I don't plan on using your data, and the addon isn't trying to collect any of your data (it's code is available for inspection [here](shift-maker-code)), but it may log parts of data that are required for debugging.

So in short - use at your own risk, there are no guarantees. I'm a good person, and you have the code to see, but this is all I can offer.
