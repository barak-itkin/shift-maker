A plugin for Google Sheets to enable working with schedule tables. This plugin has three main features:

1. Convert a schedule table into a list of events (each with room, time, duration and the text of the event), or multiple schedule tables to one big list of events with a column specifying the name of each schedule (use for multiple tables with multiple days)

2. Convert a list of events back to a schedule table (specify each column by it's title), and possibly filter only some of the events to be included (for example, only take events from a specific day or for a specific type)

3. Given a list of colored cells, each with a unique value, dynamically colorize another range using conditional formatting, whenever the destination cells contain the text in the source cells. Use this to colorize cells by event types or people, by only creating one example source range.
